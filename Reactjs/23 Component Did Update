CDU.js {
  this works after component did mount
  and this will not work unless we update state and Props
  ++ not works here buddy 

  preState is previous statevalue
  data is same as preState .... for use

  snapshot is undefined always unless getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
  gives snapshot we will learn further

  if shouldcomponentupdate() is falsed then 
  Componentdidupdate will not work

  we can call api in this if its conditional otherwise
   we will call it in component did mount
}
